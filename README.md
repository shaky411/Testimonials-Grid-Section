## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I used this challenge to practise my CSS Grid knowledge and how I can easily arrange items on a page. I will probably use this style for some of my own projects.

### Continued development

Looking to continue working on page layout for now, using grid and flexbox. Once I have mastered these techniques, I will dive a little deeper into the world of CSS.
